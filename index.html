          <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p class="bg">What would soon be universally recognized as neumorphic design was first discussed in detail by Michal Malewicz in his “Neumorphism in user interfaces” article. Taking a look at the history of UI and how user interfaces have evolved in the past 30 years, the phrase “predictably unpredictable” comes to mind. As a trend, neumorphism is said to have been kicked off by one particular Dribbble shot that went viral. The designer behind it encouraged fellow designers to “Imagine that we live in a dimension where skeuomorph is still alive and has continued its evolution in mobile interfaces. What would applications look like then? Here is my vision.”</p>

          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="bg">Why is neumorphic UI problematic? The shortest answer is that Neumorphism fails to meet some of the basic Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The same properties that make the soft extruded plastic look possible are responsible for all of the trend’s accessibility issues – including, but not limited to: poor contrast, the troublesome “light colors on a white background” Neumorphism color palette, along with the lack of icon labeling and its failing to make clear which objects are clickable, etc.<br><br>
  
        All of this is not to say that making the Neumorphism effect accessibility-friendly is impossible! Quite the contrary – it serves to prove that when we step outside of the design world, and make room for a much needed conversation on inclusivity, we can lead the entire community in the right direction.

          <h2>Overuse</h2>
      <p class="bg">The risk of going overboard when tackling neumorphic UI design is one of the most widespread drawbacks of this trend. When a design is chock-full of neumorphic UI elements, it starts looking less cohesive and simply stops making sense visually. The general consensus is that neumorphism works well for objects that are clear, legible, and arranged in a coherent structure – even if you were to completely eliminate the neumorphic aspect. Ultimately, the key lies in the self-restraint of the designer. All things in moderation, even pretty things!!</p>
